This weather App built by using the following programming languages.
* HTML
*CSS
*JAVASCRIPT
*JQUARY
*AJAX 
MOMENT.JS
In this app we can search by city name and we can use uppercase or lowercase and I made this program shift to particulat case it needs to be.
we will get weather for 5 days so that we can plan for trip accordignly.
I styled the icon to became more attractive.
Used openweathermap.org to get the API.
Used local storage to persist the city I searched up already, that will help to type less if we want to use the same city we can just enter it from the local array of cities.
Added images to show the weather by using the weather map.
